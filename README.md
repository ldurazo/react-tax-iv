This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped
with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Technologies used
- Next.js as the React framework of choice, primarily for SSR capabilities.
- React Query (Tanstack) for data synchronization / (server) state management.
- React Hook Forms library for form state machines.
- Typescript for all your type-safety pleasures.
- Jest for unit tests

### TODO
- Add Cypress component tests
- Add Cypress E2E tests
- Increase jest coverage of server & client components
